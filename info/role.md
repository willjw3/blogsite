**Current Role**<br>
I currently work as a front-end web developer for a niche importer/retailer. My primary focus is on maintaining and improving the company's e-commerce site. In addition to that, I build websites for companies whose products we import in order to help them market their products here in Japan. I mostly work within the JavaScript ecosystem, but some of my work involves scripting with Python.
