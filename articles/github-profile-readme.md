More and more, when you check out someone's GitHub profile, you see that they've been able to customize it. The first few times I noticed it, I didn't think to do the same thing to my profile. However, if everyone's going to start doing it, it would feel weird not to do something to make the profile a little more eye-catching.

You can find out more about doing this at GitHub Docs.
