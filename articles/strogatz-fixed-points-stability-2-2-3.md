This exercise is from *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, 2nd Edition* by Steven H. Strogatz

- Part 1: One-Dimensional Flows
  - 2 Flows on the Line


**Exercise 2.2.3**  
Analyze the following equation graphically. Sketch the vector field on the real line, find all the fixed points, classify their stability, and sketch the graph of $x(t)$ for different initial conditions. Then try to obtain the analytical solution for $x(t)$.

$$\dot {x} = x - x^{3}$$

From the above graph of $\dot {x} = x - x^{3}$, it's straightforward to sketch the vector field shown below it. The fixed points are $x*$ = -1, 0, and 1. $\dot {x}$ is positive to the left of $x*$ = -1, so the flow is to the right. To the right of $x*$ = -1, $\dot {x}$ is negative, so the flow is to the left. From these two facts, it's clear that $x*$ = -1 is a stable fixed point. Using the same analysis for the other fixed points, we conclude that that $x*$ = 0 is an unstable fixed point and $x*$ = 1 is a stable fixed point.

An analytic solution is possible.

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t} = x - x^{3} = x(1 -x^{2}) = x(1+x)(1-x)$$

$$\frac{1}{x(1+x)(1-x)}dx = dt$$

$$\int \frac{1}{x}dx - \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{x+1}dx - \frac{1}{2}\int\frac{1}{x-1}dx = \int_{0}^{t}dt$$

$$ln\left |x  \right | - \frac{1}{2}ln\left |x+1 \right | - \frac{1}{2}ln\left |x-1\right | + C = t$$

$$\pm \frac{x^{2}}{x^{2} - 1} = ke^{2t}$$ (must consider + and - solutions)

$$x(t) = \pm \frac{\sqrt{k}e^{t}}{\sqrt{ke^{2t}-1}}$$

and

$$x(t) = \pm \frac{\sqrt{k}e^{t}}{\sqrt{ke^{2t}+1}}$$

Solutions tend toward $\pm \ 1$ as t goes to $\pm \infty $
