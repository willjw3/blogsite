I don't know why I didn't do this years ago. It was frustrating, but a supremely rewarding experience. And now I have a beast of a machine compared to what I've used previously. Need to work on cable management, though.

**Parts Used**

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3800x
- Motherboard: msi MPG X570 Gaming Plus
- SSD: Samsung Evo 970 Plus 500GB
- GPU: ASRock Phantom Gaming Radeon RX 580
- Memory: Corsair Vengeance RGB 16GB
- Total Cost: ~$1200 US

Living in Japan, parts are a little more expensive here, so had I built the same machine in the US, it would have cost around $1000 US.
